Perl-Analyzer

This is a set of programs (and modules which can be used separately)
that allow you to analyse and visualise Perl codebases:

* Namespaces and their relations
* Dependencies, i.e. list of 'use'd or 'require'd packages
* Inheritance, i.e. list of parent packages
* Methods implemented in package
* Methods inherited from parent packages
* Methods redefined from parent packages
* Calls to methods from parent package via SUPER

The software is split into two parts - analyzer (perl-analyzer, which uses
Perl::Analyzer module) and renderer (perl-analyzer-output, which uses
Perl::Analyzer::Output and related plugins).
